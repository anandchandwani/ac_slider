# Whiteboarding Checklist

**Format of whiteboarding (in order)**

- [ ] Mercury Repeats and clarifies problem after hearing it (should ask questions to interviewer)
- [ ]  Uses diagrams to explain approach
- [ ] Pseudocodes problem after discussing approach with interviewer
- [ ] Code should be clean:
- [ ] Uses newMax = Math.max(newMax, possibleMax) vs. conditional
- [ ] Walks through solution using simple example
- [ ] Talks about edge cases
- [ ] Talks about time and space complexity and optimizations (optimizes problem if time, if not enough time, should verbally 
   explain how to optimize)



# Whiteboarding Style

- [ ]  Should maintain constant communication with interviewer - there should not be any awkward silences - should talk with 
   interviewer while writing pseudocode out 
- [ ]  Starts on top left side of the board and moves to right - ensures that there is enough room to work with so that solutions 
   arenâ€™t cramped
