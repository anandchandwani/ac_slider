## Hiring Program: Resume Checklist


#### Header

*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Name, email (click to link), city (be as general as possible when listing your City, ex. Los Angeles, you do not need to list  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your exact address), cellphone	
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Website with your own domain (Elective)	
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Github (hyperlink)	
*-*  &nbsp;&nbsp;"Linkedin (hyperlink, direct name, not the /pub/ see this [link](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/87/~/customizing-your-public-profile-url%22))

#### Technical Skills overview

*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Breakdown into one or two sections (experienced and strong). Fill one entire line each. Be concise. More does not mean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better - do not list both Mongoose and MongoDB, the more general one - MongoDB in this case<br>
*-* &nbsp; Be aware of the order at which the skills are the listed 	- if you list too many frontend heavy skills first, engineers / recruiters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will assume that you are a front-end developer. Balance out your frontend / backend skills if you are interested in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying that you are a full stack developer<br>
*-* &nbsp; During the interview, you should be able to talk about each point for at least 2 minutes under the strong section <br>
*-* &nbsp; These skills must be listed in the strong section : Javascript (it’s what you have been using these past 3+ months), Git (all  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies use version control), (one type of database). If you are uncomfortable putting these in your strong section, you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must research these topics in detail until you are comfortable with it

#### Professional Experience	
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Production project<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-* &nbsp;&nbsp; Write a simple, very short, clear description of problem, solution<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide the most remarkable technical challenges (new technology a plus)<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the release/impact stats, ie "Top of Echo.js", "npm package 500+ downloads"

*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior software engineering experience<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-* &nbsp;&nbsp; Emphasis on team and production-level software engineering experience *at scale*<br><br>
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-software engineering experience<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;One paragraph about scale and prestige of job<br> 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;One paragraph about highly technical component<br> 

#### Project

*-*&nbsp;2-3 projects listed (no more than 3 - it's better to have fewer larger projects than more smaller ones - you can always &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mention additional projects in interview)<br>
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, very short, clear description of problem. List the solution under each project	
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Devote no more than one line to describing the technologies used. “Technologies used” can be listed in the description.
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;List the most  remarkable technical challenges under each project (new technology a plus)	

#### Education	

*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;List university attended and major - should not be more than 2 lines (unless you are engineering oriented and can list at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least 5 items for relevant coursework).

#### Interests

*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests should include achievements or actions taken to demonstrate excellence (top 80% percentile) or passion in area &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(started university hip-hop club, nationally ranked in Starcraft)

#### Formatting

*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no single-word lines. All lines fill up at least 80% of page width.<br>
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections are clearly divided. Be sure the page does not look cluttered.<br>
*-*&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t try to be creative with resume design unless the goal is to be excellent front-end developer / designer


#### General
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Be conscious about the focus of your resume. If you list a lot of front-end skills and not that much back-related experience, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people will think you like front-end development. If you are interested in full-stack development, show balance between  &nbsp;&nbsp;both<br>
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid extreme words like: best, first, all<br>
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid pronouns : our, we, I, you<br>
*-* &nbsp;&nbsp;When creating hyperlinks to your projects, email, LinkededIn, etc, please remove the underline and change the font color  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to black. The hyperlink will be preserved and the font will look cleaner<br>
<span style="color:red"> -&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPORTANT - The primary source of your resume must be in google docs (not Microsoft Word or Pages as formatting is  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not consistent when imported into google docs)</span>
